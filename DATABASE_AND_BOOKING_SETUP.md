# Database and Booking Setup - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of two major features:
1. **Dynamic Booking Availability** - All time slots are now available for booking
2. **Supabase Database Integration** - Complete database setup for storing customer submissions

---

## Part 1: Booking Availability Update

### What Changed

Previously, some booking time slots were hardcoded as unavailable. This has been updated so that **all time slots are now available** for customers to select. The team will manually confirm availability with customers via phone or email.

### Files Modified

**`src/app/pages/booking/booking.component.ts`** (Line 1712-1724)

```typescript
// All time slots are available - team will manually confirm availability with customers
timeSlots: TimeSlot[] = [
  { time: '08:00', available: true },
  { time: '09:00', available: true },
  { time: '10:00', available: true },  // ✅ Previously false
  { time: '11:00', available: true },
  { time: '12:00', available: true },  // ✅ New time slot
  { time: '13:00', available: true },
  { time: '14:00', available: true },
  { time: '15:00', available: true },  // ✅ Previously false
  { time: '16:00', available: true },
  { time: '17:00', available: true }   // ✅ New time slot
];
```

### How It Works

1. Customer selects any available time slot during booking
2. Booking request is submitted to both email and database
3. Team reviews the request in the admin panel
4. Team contacts customer to confirm or propose alternative times
5. Booking status is updated in the admin panel

---

## Part 2: Supabase Database Integration

### What Was Implemented

A complete PostgreSQL database solution using Supabase to store all customer contact and booking submissions. This provides:

- Permanent storage of all customer requests
- Admin panel to view and manage submissions
- Status tracking for each request
- Urgent request filtering
- Statistics and analytics

### New Files Created

1. **`SUPABASE_SETUP.md`** - Complete setup guide for Supabase
2. **`src/app/services/supabase.service.ts`** - Database service
3. **`src/app/pages/admin/admin.ts`** - Admin panel component
4. **`src/app/pages/admin/admin.html`** - Admin panel template
5. **`src/app/pages/admin/admin.scss`** - Admin panel styles

### Files Modified

1. **`src/environments/environment.ts`** - Added Supabase configuration
2. **`src/environments/environment.prod.ts`** - Added Supabase configuration
3. **`src/app/services/email.service.ts`** - Integrated database storage
4. **`src/app/app.routes.ts`** - Added admin route

---

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

#### 1. `contact_submissions`

Stores all contact form submissions.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (UUID) - Unique identifier
- `created_at` (Timestamp) - Submission date/time
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `phone` - Customer info
- `service_type`, `property_size`, `preferred_date` - Request details
- `message` (Text) - Customer's message
- `urgent_request` (Boolean) - 48-hour urgent flag
- `status` (String) - pending, contacted, resolved
- `language` (String) - Customer's language preference (fr/en)

#### 2. `booking_requests`

Stores all booking form submissions.

**Key Fields:**
- `id` (UUID) - Unique identifier
- `created_at` (Timestamp) - Submission date/time
- `service_type`, `service_name`, `service_price` - Service details
- `property_type`, `property_size`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms` - Property details
- `address`, `city`, `postal_code` - Location
- `preferred_date`, `preferred_time`, `frequency` - Scheduling
- `additional_services` (JSONB) - Selected add-ons

- `subtotal`, `taxes`, `total` - Financial summary
- `status` (String) - pending, contacted, confirmed, completed, cancelled
- `language` (String) - Customer's language preference (fr/en)

### Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enabled
- Public users can only INSERT (submit forms)
- Only authenticated users can view/update records
- No data can be deleted through the API

---

## How the System Works

### Customer Journey

1. **Customer submits form** (Contact or Booking)
   - Form data is validated
   - Submission is saved to Supabase database
   - Two emails are sent:
     - Business email (French, to econetentretienmenager@gmail.com)
     - Customer confirmation (in their selected language)
   - Success modal is displayed

2. **Database Storage**
   - Even if email fails, data is saved to database
   - Includes metadata: timestamp, language, user agent
   - Status is set to "pending"

### Business Team Workflow

1. **Access Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to `/admin` route
   - View statistics dashboard showing:
     - Total contacts
     - Total bookings
     - Urgent requests
     - Pending bookings

2. **Review Submissions**
   - Three tabs: Bookings, Contacts, Urgent
   - Each submission shows full customer details
   - Urgent requests are highlighted

3. **Update Status**
   - Change status via dropdown: pending → contacted → confirmed/resolved
   - Status changes are saved to database
   - Timestamps are automatically recorded

4. **Contact Customer**
   - Email and phone visible in admin panel
   - Team contacts customer to confirm availability
   - Update booking status once confirmed

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Sign up and create new project
3. Note your Project URL and anon key

**Detailed instructions in:** `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

### Step 2: Run Database Schema

1. In Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy SQL from `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
3. Execute to create tables and security policies

### Step 3: Update Environment Files

**`src/environments/environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`:**

```typescript
supabase: {
  url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL',  // Replace this
  anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY'  // Replace this
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 5: Test the System

1. Submit a contact form or booking
2. Check Supabase Table Editor for new record
3. Check email inbox for confirmation emails
4. Navigate to `/admin` to view submission in admin panel

## API Integration Details

### Supabase Service Methods

**`SupabaseService`** (`src/app/services/supabase.service.ts`)

**Write Methods:**
- `saveContactSubmission(data)` - Insert contact submission
- `saveBookingRequest(data)` - Insert booking request
- `updateContactStatus(id, status, notes)` - Update contact status
- `updateBookingStatus(id, status, notes, date, time)` - Update booking status

**Read Methods:**
- `getRecentContacts(limit)` - Fetch recent contact submissions
- `getRecentBookings(limit)` - Fetch recent bookings
- `getUrgentContacts()` - Fetch unresolved urgent requests
- `isConfigured()` - Check if Supabase is set up

### Email Service Integration

**`EmailService`** (`src/app/services/email.service.ts`)

Both `sendContactForm()` and `sendBookingForm()` now:
1. Save to database first (if configured)
2. Send business email (French)
3. Send customer confirmation (their language)
4. Return success/failure status

If database save fails, the system continues with email sending to ensure customer experience is not interrupted.

---

## Status Workflow

### Contact Submissions

1. **pending** → Initial submission
2. **contacted** → Team has reached out to customer
3. **resolved** → Issue/request has been resolved

### Booking Requests

1. **pending** → Initial booking request
2. **contacted** → Team has reached out to customer
3. **confirmed** → Booking date/time confirmed
4. **completed** → Service has been completed
5. **cancelled** → Booking was cancelled

---

## Free Tier Limits

Supabase free tier includes:
- **500 MB** database storage
- **1 GB** file storage
- **2 GB** bandwidth per month
- **Unlimited** API requests
- **Daily** automatic backups

This is more than sufficient for initial operations. Estimated capacity: ~50,000 submissions.

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions for the future:

1. **Authentication** - Add login for admin panel
2. **Email Notifications** - Alert team of urgent requests
3. **Calendar Integration** - Sync confirmed bookings to Google Calendar
4. **Customer Portal** - Allow customers to view booking status
5. **Analytics** - Dashboard with charts and trends
6. **Automated Responses** - Send automatic follow-up emails

## Troubleshooting

### Database not saving submissions

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase credentials in environment files
3. Restart development server after updating environment
4. Check Supabase dashboard for API errors

### Admin panel shows "not configured"

1. Verify environment files have correct Supabase URL and key
2. Restart development server (`npm start`)
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Emails not being received

- This is independent of database
- Check `EMAIL_SETUP.md` for email troubleshooting
- Database will still store submissions even if email fails
